## Overview

Syllabus Planner is a frontend-only application designed to help students create a personalized study timetable based on their exam syllabus. The application will feature a clean, intuitive interface, using a minimalist design with pastel colors to create a calming and focused environment. All functionality, including the study plan generation, will be simulated entirely on the client-side, making the application feel responsive without any need for a backend.

The application's core function is to take the exam syllabus as input and generate a study plan that suggests how much time to dedicate to each topic per day. The syllabus will be inputted through a simple form where users can add topics and their respective study times or weights. The application will then use this information to create a mock study plan, distributing the total study time across the available days before the exam. The plan will be visually presented in a calendar format, showing the suggested study topics and times for each day.

Here is a breakdown of the core features and components:
*   **Pages:**
  *   **Syllabus Input:** A page where users can input their exam syllabus, adding topics and their study times or weights.
  *   **Study Plan:** A page that displays the generated study plan in a calendar format.
*   **Core Components:**
  *   **`SyllabusForm`:** A form where users can input their syllabus details, including topics and study times.
  *   **`StudyPlanGenerator`:** A component that takes the syllabus input and generates a study plan, distributing study time across the available days.
  *   **`CalendarView`:** A component that visually presents the study plan in a calendar format, showing the suggested study topics and times for each day.
*   **Mock Data Structure:**
  *   The syllabus will be represented as an array of topic objects: `[{ id: 1, name: 'Topic A', studyTime: 10 }, { id: 2, name: 'Topic B', studyTime: 15 }]`.
  *   The study plan will be generated based on the syllabus data and the number of days before the exam, using a simple algorithm to distribute study time.
